# CSV indexing

The aim is to build a golang project that implements indexing of a csv file using a normal B-tree. I used this project to learn golang.

I implemented this project a while ago and have recently gone through cleaning it up. 
I specifically renamed all the commits using a rebase which has adjusted the times of the commits.

### Future ideas:

- implement B+ tree version

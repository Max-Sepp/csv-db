# CSV indexing

The aim is to build a golang project that implements indexing of a csv file using a normal B-tree. I used this project to learn golang.

I implemented this project a while ago and have recently gone through cleaning it up. 
I specifically renamed all the commits using a rebase which has adjusted the times of the commits. 

The original project can be found here: [https://github.com/Max-Sepp/csv-db-old](https://github.com/Max-Sepp/csv-db-old) (Note: I have made changes to this repo that do not appear in the older one)


### Future ideas:

- implement B+ tree version
